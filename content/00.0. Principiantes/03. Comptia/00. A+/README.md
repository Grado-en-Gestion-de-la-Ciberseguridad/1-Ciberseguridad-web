## Hardware
It is important to not only know the different types of computer hardware, but to also understand how they work and actions you can take if they malfunction. This  Hardware study guide will review all of the hardware types covered on the CompTIA A+ Core Series 1101 test as well as information that will help you deal with hardware issues. Be sure to access our practice questions and flashcards to give you a feel for how to use this information.

## Hardware and Network Troubleshooting
It’s great to know the characteristics and functionality of equipment and networks, but you also need to know what to do when they don’t work as they should. You will be the “doctor” of sorts and there needs to be an effective plan in place for dealing with problems. Use this  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting study guide to help you understand the necessary steps you can take to ensure good outcomes for all.

## Mobile Devices
Mobile devices are playing an increasing part in technology use today. Gone are the times when you could assume that if someone was working on a computer, he or she was using a desktop model. Now, more often than not, a much smaller, more portable device is operational and the technology of these devices and their functions are changing constantly. Use this  Mobile Devices study guide to learn what you need to know to tackle mobile device questions on the test.

## Networking
Networks: how they are configured, how they work, major and minor parts, and what to do if they don’t work for some reason. All these and more are covered in the Networking questions on the CompTIA A+ Core Series test . Browse through the concepts in this  Networking study guide and find out what you need to study before test day.

## Virtualization and Cloud Computing
This group of questions was completely new to the previous edition of the CompTIA A+ Core exam. For test editions before the last one, some of these concepts might have been touched on in other areas of study, but this is the second edition of the test that devotes an entire section of study to these topics. Use this  Virtualization and Cloud Computing study guide to direct your review and seek out our practice questions and flashcards to see what you’ve mastered.

## Operating Systems
Beginning with the 2019 CompTIA A+ test, Windows was no longer separated from other operating systems. This newest test version also combines all operating systems in the tested concepts list. Whatever the system, you’ll need to be familiar with it, and this  Operating Systems study guide will tell you just what you need to know about all of them.

## Operational Procedures
Anything tends to work better with a plan in place that covers all situations, and technology-related operations are no exception. Use this  Operational Procedures study guide to find out what is involved in setting and following procedures and learn what you need to know for this type of question on the test.
## Security
There’s probably not a hotter topic on the technology scene today than this one—security. It’s at the tip of every tongue and arouses more concern than just about any other tech feature. Meanwhile, threat actors are finding even more devious and sophisticated ways to hack an IT system. Use this  Security study guide to help you know how to prepare for security-related questions on the test.

## Software Troubleshooting
Software is an extremely valuable technology resource when it works correctly. When it doesn’t, it will be up to you to determine the problem and devise a solution. Use this  Software Troubleshooting study guide to help widen your knowledge in this area and go over what you need to know for this area of questioning on the CompTIA A+ Core Series  test.
