**Event 16** - [**Financial Transaction Fraud**] - **February 4, 2016** – The Bangladesh Bank heist occurs: following the close of business of the Bangladesh Bank on Thursday (i.e., the beginning of the weekend for the bank), from 8:36pm through 10:30pm local time (9:55am to 11:30am EST), DPRK hackers send 36 fraudulent payment orders for nearly $1 billion to the New York Fed.

Only 1 order included intermediary bank routing information (a payment for $20 million routed to the “Shalika Fundation” in Sri Lanka, which was flagged). The other 34 were rejected by the New York Fed for missing this information, prompting the hackers to update and resend the instructions between 11:30pm and 1am (Feb. 5) local time (12:30pm to 2pm EST). One instruction was omitted from this second batch. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 17** - [**Data Deletion / Financial Fraud Continuation**] - **February 5, 2016** – The Bangladesh Bank heist continues in Philippine local time. The DPRK hackers logged out of the SWIFT system at 3:59am, prompting malware to begin deleting files to hide evidence of the heist. (Source: Park Jin Hyok indictment.)

The New York Fed executed four of the payment orders (on Feb. 4 EST). The funds were routed to correspondent accounts held by the RCBC at Wells Fargo, the Bank of New York Mellon, and Citibank using the Fedwire system. The Fedwire system allowed for an immediate transfer from the New York Fed to the correspondent accounts, enabling RCBC to transfer the funds to the Philippines on the same business day. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 18** - [**Financial Fraud / Money Laundering**] - **Between 11:30pm and 12:00am:** Kam Sin Wong (the owner of Eastern Hawaii Leisure) calls Maia Santos Deguito (the branch manager of RCBC’s Jupiter branch) to ask whether a deposit had been transferred into the Cruz account.

- Cruz account receives $6,000,029.12
- Lagrosas account receives $30,000,028.79
- Vergara account receives $30,000,028.79
- Vasquez account receives $19,999,990.00
- Picache account does not receive money ($170 million in fraudulent payment instructions were intended for the account, but the instructions were not executed by the New York Fed.)

	**2:51pm:** Michael Bautista (co-owner of Philrem) initiates the process of purchasing $13,500,000 pesos from RCBC’s Treasury. Philrem’s involvement was to make it difficult to trace the source and flow of the funds, and to act as a “clearing house” for the funds. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

	**3:00pm:** Deguito opens a fraudulent U.S. dollar account in the name of William So Go, doing business as Centurytex Trading; at 3:13pm, $22,735,000 is withdrawn from the Lagrosas account through a “cash withdrawal” (despite the branch not having that much cash on hand) and deposited into the Centurytex account. The Centurytex account then made two transfers of $14,200,000 and $500,000 to Philrem’s dollar account at RCBC’s Unimart branch, which subsequently made two transfers of $13,500,000 and $500,000 to its peso account. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 19** - [**Financial Fraud / Cash Withdrawal**] - **By 7:00pm:** RCBC requests a delivery of 20 million pesos in cash (approximately $380,000) to be delivered to the Jupiter branch from the Makati Cash Center. The cash is then withdrawn from the Centurytex account and hand-delivered to someone identified as “William So Go.” The CCTV system at RCBC’s Jupiter Branch was not working during this time, making it impossible to identify to whom this money was actually given. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

- **6:45pm-7:04pm:** A hold is briefly placed on the Centurytex account but is lifted within 45 minutes (around 7:29pm) by RCBC management. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

At some point on February 5, Bangladesh bank personnel shut down their server. (Source: Park Jin Hyok indictment.)

**Event 20** - [**Malware Deployment / Data Deletion**] - **February 6, 2016** – Lazarus Group malware is intended to delete the stored records of messages on the SWIFT server; due to the server shutdown the previous day, the malware fails to execute. (Source: Park Jin Hyok indictment.)

**Event 21** - [**System Access Control**] - **February 7, 2016** – Someone, likely from RCBC’s Head Office, logs RCBC out of the SWIFT system. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 22** - [**Financial Control / Countermeasures**] - **February 8, 2016** – Due to the Chinese New Year, a Philippine holiday, RCBC remained closed over a long weekend. The Bangladesh Bank sends SWIFT messages to RCBC requesting stop payments to the Vazquez, Vergara, and Lagrosas accounts and for RCBC to freeze the three accounts. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 23** - [**Financial Fraud / Money Laundering**] - **February 9, 2016** – RCBC logs back into the SWIFT system and reviews the stop payment and hold messages, which RCBC claims were forwarded to the Jupiter Branch at 10:59am. Throughout the day on Feb. 9:

- $58.2 million are withdrawn from the fictitious accounts, draining them.
- $42.9 million is deposited into the Centurytex account
- $15.2 million is deposited in the Philrem account.

Also throughout the day, Bautista begins the process of converting the money into the Philippine peso. RCBC initiated a series of transactions to move portions of the money into different accounts. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

- **3:31pm:** RCBC places a hold on the fictitious accounts and sends a SWIFT message to the Bangladesh Bank, withholding the fact that the money had already been transferred from the accounts. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 24** - [**Financial Fraud / Money Laundering**] - **February 10, 2016** – The Bangladesh Bank sends a stop payment for the fourth fictitious account (the Cruz account). RCBC continued with the process of transferring money and converting it into Philippine pesos. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

- Wong withdraws the funds and begins a complicated series of transactions using the funds.

**Event 25** - [**Money Laundering**] - **February 11, 2016** – By 3:14pm, all the money from the fictitious accounts had been deposited into the Philrem account. Of the $81,001,617.12 stolen, $80,880,000 made its way into Philrem’s dollar account. $80,691,772 was converted into Philippine pesos and transferred to Philrem’s peso account, and then subsequently transferred to accounts at other banks. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

- Philrem transfers another 500 million pesos to the Eastern Hawaii Leisure account. Collectively, these transfers account for approximately $21,052,631.58 of the original funds.

- **6:35pm:** Deguito finally files a suspicious transaction report, which is approved by RCBC’s Anti Money Laundering Department. No further action was taken by the AML Department. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

**Event 26** - [**Money Laundering**] - **From February 5-March 10, 2016** – Philrem uses stolen funds to purchase $29,000,000 worth of non-negotiable Solaire Casino chips. The chips remained in play for multiple gaming sessions for over a month. (Source: Bangladesh complaint.)

- 100 million pesos of this cash was allegedly deposited at the Solaire Casino, while another 300 million was deposited at the Midas Casino (run by Wong), but it is unclear whether the money was converted to chips and played.
