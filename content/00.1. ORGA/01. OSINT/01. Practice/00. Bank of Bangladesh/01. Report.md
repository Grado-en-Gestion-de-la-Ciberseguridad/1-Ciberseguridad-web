### **Lazarus Group and the Bangladesh Bank Heist Report**

#### **Introduction**

In February 2016, the Bangladesh Bank experienced one of the most significant financial cyberattacks in history, resulting in the attempted theft of nearly $1 billion from its Federal Reserve account in New York. This heist, attributed to the North Korean hacking group known as Lazarus Group (also referred to as APT38), stands as a hallmark case of the dangerous capabilities of state-sponsored hacking. Over the course of two years leading up to the heist, Lazarus Group carried out a series of sophisticated cyber activities, including reconnaissance, spear phishing, and lateral movement within banking systems, which culminated in the theft of $81 million. This report outlines the key phases of the operation, highlighting how the hackers infiltrated Bangladesh Bank’s systems, executed their heist, and attempted to launder the stolen funds.

#### **Timeline of Events**

The attack on Bangladesh Bank is part of a broader campaign conducted by Lazarus Group targeting banks across the globe, often through the exploitation of the SWIFT banking system. The timeline of events leading up to and following the attack is critical to understanding the full scope of the operation.

##### **Initial Reconnaissance and Intrusion (2014-2015)**

The earliest known activity by Lazarus Group that would eventually lead to the Bangladesh Bank heist dates back to February 2014, when DPRK hackers began laying the groundwork for attacks on financial institutions【Event 1】. By July of the same year, accounts in the Philippines were set up under fictitious names, possibly to facilitate the money laundering phase of future operations【Event 2】. 

The hackers began targeting Bangladesh Bank in October 2014, when they conducted online reconnaissance on the bank and other related financial entities【Event 3】. Their reconnaissance included researching bank staff, procedures, and vulnerabilities in the SWIFT system. This phase would later allow them to craft precise spear phishing campaigns designed to breach the bank’s network.

##### **Infiltration of Bangladesh Bank (2015)**

By early 2015, the Lazarus Group's reconnaissance efforts escalated into more aggressive action. In January, they began conducting specific research on key employees at Bangladesh Bank【Event 5】【Event 6】, focusing on spear phishing tactics to infiltrate the network. These attacks involved sending emails with malicious links, designed to deploy malware once clicked. The group’s reconnaissance evolved into full-blown cyberattacks in February 2015, when emails containing malware links were sent to multiple employees【Event 7】.

By March 2015, the hackers had successfully gained access to Bangladesh Bank’s network, and they deployed a backdoor that allowed them to move laterally within the bank’s systems【Event 8】. This malware enabled file transfers and command executions that allowed the hackers to create a foothold, positioning them to carry out the heist the following year.

##### **Preparation and Execution of the Heist (2015-2016)**

In the latter half of 2015, the Lazarus Group focused on positioning themselves to carry out their financial theft. They continued to monitor Bangladesh Bank’s systems and began lateral movement towards the SWIFTLIVE system, a critical component of the bank’s operations【Event 15】. By December, the hackers attempted a SWIFT-based attack on TPBank in Vietnam, which failed【Event 14】, but this test run would serve as a precursor to the Bangladesh Bank heist.

On February 4, 2016, Lazarus Group initiated their heist, sending 36 fraudulent payment orders via the SWIFT network from Bangladesh Bank’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York【Event 16】. The orders totaled nearly $1 billion, with the funds being routed to accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Due to missing routing information in some of the payment orders, most were rejected, but four transactions, amounting to $81 million, were processed.

##### **Cover-Up and Laundering of Funds (February 2016)**

Once the funds were successfully transferred, the hackers quickly initiated steps to cover their tracks. In the early hours of February 5, 2016, they logged out of Bangladesh Bank’s SWIFT system, triggering malware designed to delete logs and hide evidence of their activity【Event 17】. However, due to Bangladesh Bank personnel shutting down their server during this time, parts of the malware failed to execute【Event 20】.

Meanwhile, the stolen funds were laundered through multiple fictitious accounts at Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) in the Philippines【Event 9】【Event 13】. This process involved converting the funds into pesos through a foreign exchange broker (Philrem) and then routing them through casinos and other channels to obscure their origin【Event 18】【Event 22】. The involvement of local businesspeople and casino operators further complicated efforts to track the money.

#### **Aftermath and Global Impact**

The Bangladesh Bank heist sent shockwaves through the global financial system. Although the hackers initially attempted to steal nearly $1 billion, quick action by the New York Federal Reserve and other banking institutions prevented the full amount from being withdrawn. However, of the $81 million that was successfully stolen, only a fraction has been recovered.

The heist also revealed critical vulnerabilities in the SWIFT system, which is used by financial institutions around the world to process international payments. In response, SWIFT and its member banks have implemented stronger security protocols, but the incident remains a reminder of the persistent threat posed by state-sponsored cybercriminals.

Additionally, the attack on Bangladesh Bank was part of a broader campaign by Lazarus Group, which has targeted other banks in Vietnam, Taiwan, Chile, and Mexico【Event 14】【Event 28】【Event 29】【Event 30】【Event 31】. These attacks underscore the group’s focus on financial targets and their ability to exploit weaknesses in global financial systems for the benefit of the North Korean regime.

#### **Conclusion**

The Bangladesh Bank heist stands as one of the most significant cyberattacks on a financial institution in modern history. Lazarus Group's highly coordinated attack demonstrated the dangerous potential of state-sponsored cyber warfare, particularly when it comes to financial institutions. While Bangladesh Bank and global authorities have taken steps to prevent a repeat of such incidents, the heist remains a crucial case study in cybersecurity, financial fraud, and international law enforcement efforts against cybercrime.

The Lazarus Group continues to pose a threat to financial institutions worldwide, and their success in infiltrating Bangladesh Bank serves as a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses in an increasingly interconnected world.
